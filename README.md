# AirWatcher

In this project, we will put our software engineering knowledge into practice to develop an application: **AirWatcher**. This application will allow users to visualize air quality based on sensor data. It will be used by various types of users, including:

- **Government**: To monitor and analyze air quality at the local and national levels.
- **Suppliers**: Those who provide sensors and air purifiers can use the data to improve their products and services.
- **Voluntary private users**: Individuals can install sensors in their homes to monitor the air quality in their immediate environment.

## Features

### For the Government

- **Air quality monitoring**: Access to real-time data from sensors installed across the territory.
- **Data analysis**: Tools to analyze trends and identify problem areas.
- **Reports**: Generation of detailed air quality reports for decision-making and public communication.

### For Suppliers

- **Sensor management**: Monitoring of deployed sensors, including their status and performance.
- **Product improvement**: Using the data to improve sensors and air purifiers.
- **Customer support**: Providing information and recommendations based on air quality data.

### For Private Users

- **Sensor installation**: Guide and support for installing sensors at home.
- **Personal monitoring**: Access to air quality data inside and around their home.
- **Notifications**: Alerts and recommendations in case of poor air quality.
